In the paper, we introduce logic-guided data augmentation and regularization to improve accuracy and consistency in a range of question answering datasets, namely [WIQA](https://allenai.org/data/wiqa), [QuaRel](https://allenai.org/data/quarel) and [HotpotQA (comparison)](https://hotpotqa.github.io/).
